1. Localized Flow Probe (de Leeuw & van Wijk, 1993)The flow probe is designed for the interactive visualization of local flow field characteristics, moving beyond simple arrow representations to visualize changes in velocity described by a second-order real tensor.Algorithmic Methodology and DecompositionThe algorithm approximates the velocity $u(x)$ near a point $x_0$ using a first-order Taylor expansion: $u(x) = u(x_0) + J(x - x_0)$, where $J$ is the Jacobian matrix (velocity gradient tensor). To make the tensor components physically interpretable, the method employs a specific decomposition strategy:Local Coordinate Frame: The tensor is transformed into a Frenet frame. The x-axis is aligned with the velocity vector $u$, and the y-axis is parallel to the curvature vector $c$.Curvature Calculation: The curvature vector $c$ is derived from the Jacobian and velocity as $c = \frac{Ju(u \cdot u) - u(u \cdot Ju)}{|u|^3}$.Parallel/Perpendicular Decomposition: The tensor is split into components parallel with the flow (Acceleration, Shear, Curvature) and perpendicular to the flow (Torsion, Convergence/Divergence).Geometric Implementation (Primitives)The derived quantities are mapped onto distinct geometric primitives to form a unified probe:Velocity & Curvature: Represented by an arrow where the shaft length is $l = u \Delta t$. The shaft is rendered as an arc of the osculating circle to visualize the first-order approximation of the streamline.Acceleration: Visualized by a membrane perpendicular to the flow; positive acceleration (acceleration) or negative (deceleration) causes the center of the membrane to bulge forward or backward.Torsion: Represented as "candy stripes" on the arrow surface, reflecting the rotation around the velocity axis.Shear: Visualized as a "shear-ring" that represents the change in orientation of the plane perpendicular to the flow over time.Convergence/Divergence: Modeled as an osculating paraboloid surface (a "lens") that indicates how the flow focuses or spreads.Scientific FindingsThe probe provides detailed local information that global methods like volume rendering or topology often obscure. It allows researchers to investigate fluid element distortions—specifically how a "fluid line" and "fluid plane" deform within the field.2. Superquadric Tensor Glyphs (Kindlmann, 2004)Kindlmann introduced superquadric surfaces to address the inherent visual ambiguities and asymmetries of traditional tensor glyphs like cuboids and ellipsoids.Problem Statement and MotivationCuboids: Display misleadingly sharp orientations for tensors with rotational symmetry (where eigenvectors are under-constrained).Ellipsoids: Suffer from visual ambiguity; tensors with significantly different shapes can produce similar profiles and shading from certain viewpoints.Mathematical FrameworkThe algorithm utilizes the barycentric shape space defined by Westin’s metrics ($c_l$, $c_p$, $c_s$) to quantify linear, planar, and spherical anisotropy:$c_l = \frac{\lambda_1 - \lambda_2}{\sum \lambda_i}$ (Linear) $c_p = \frac{2(\lambda_2 - \lambda_3)}{\sum \lambda_i}$ (Planar) $c_s = \frac{3\lambda_3}{\sum \lambda_i}$ (Spherical) The glyph geometry is controlled by parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, which are tuned based on the anisotropy metrics and a user-defined edge sharpness parameter $\gamma$. For example, when $c_l \ge c_p$:
$$\alpha = (1 - c_p)^\gamma$$$$\beta = (1 - c_l)^\gamma$$.Implementation and ResultsThe base glyph geometry $G$ is transformed into a tensor glyph $G_T$ using the rotation matrix of eigenvectors $R$ and the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues $\Lambda$: $G_T = R \Lambda G$.Symmetry and Continuity: Superquadrics exhibit circular cross-sections when two eigenvalues are equal, effectively conveying rotational symmetry.Visual Clarity: The use of sharp edges (driven by $\gamma$) signifies anisotropy and provides a stronger orientation cue than rounded ellipsoids.Application: In DT-MRI brain datasets, superquadric glyphs more clearly depict the orientation of planar anisotropy in complex white matter branching compared to ellipsoidal representations.Scientific FindingsSuperquadrics create a tunable continuum that imitates cylinders for linear cases, discs for planar cases, and spheres for isotropic cases. This flexibility reduces visual ambiguity while maintaining a mathematically continuous seam between different shape regions
