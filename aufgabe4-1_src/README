This is the FAnToM toolbox for Aufgabe 4.1: Superquadric Tensor Glyphs & Localized Flow Probe.

The build needs the directory where FAnToM has been installed to. Because of the special precautions that we have taken,
the build directory of FAnToM can be used directly here, without the need for an installation.

To build the toolbox, run the following commands (assuming the CWD is the toolbox directory)
  - mkdir build
  - cd build
  - FANTOM_DIR=/path/to/FAnToM/install-dir/or/build-dir cmake ../
  - make

Put all your plugins in subdirectories of the toolbox directory.
Plugins need a specific directory layout:

toolbox-dir/
  - CMakeLists.txt   - the main build script
  - build            - the build dir
  - plugin1/
    - FAnToM-Dependencies.txt
    - algos/
      - LocalizedFlowProbe.cpp
      - SuperquadricTensorGlyphs.cpp

If your plugin needs additional external libraries, find them in your CMakeLists.txt, declare them as imported targets,
list them in the plugin1_LIBS and call FANTOM_ADD_PLUGIN( plugin1 ).
Dependencies to FAnToM default libraries (DEFAULT/Python, DEFAULT/OpenGL) or FAnToM plugins (e.g., utils/Graphics, utils/math) can be listed
in the FAnToM-Dependencies.txt directly.

Use
   make run
or
   make debug
to run/debug your plugin.

When installing the build, the generated plugin libraries and data files are merged directly into the FAnToM directory hierarchy.
